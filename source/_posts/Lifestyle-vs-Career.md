### Introduction

For much of my life, I have been considering exactly what ratio of career to lifestyle is ideal. Even before University, I was pondering where and how I should be living. Career gives meaning and obviously the ability to afford lifestyle, but lifestyle allows you to find enjoyment, refresh your mind and give you something to progress on outside of work. There's also the added benefit of being more physically healthy depending on your lifestyle activities.

This a balancing act that I believe is relative. Some people strive on being career driven, putting in 80-90 hours a week to succeed in business. It is not uncommon to come across these type of people, but at the same time, you have to realize that not everyone can maintain and get satisfaction from devoting so much into their career.

For this reason, I decided to quit my job in Matamata and pursue a job where I am free to do the activities I love to do. Such as mountain biking and running. Luckily I was able to find a job in one such place.

### Taupo

Say hello to Taupo. Home to mountain biking, hiking, geothermal pools, white water rafting, trout fishing, jet boating, helicopter flights over the Tongariro National Park, skiing, snowboarding, and so much more!

I am already overwhelmed but just how many activities there are to do in Taupo, and how cold the winters really are here.

Moving to Taupo was by no means an easy decision. Living in Matamata for 11 months allowed me to form close relationships with people. People who inspired me to look beyond what I thought I was capable of. Leaving behind a comfortable and predictable life in Matamata to move to a city where I know no-one, nothing is predictable and everything is new was and still is a much harder challenge than I had anticipated.

Working at [NinetyBlack](https://www.ninetyblack.com/) as a Full Stack Developer, I have also opted to work a 4 day work week, giving me a 3 day weekend, truly allowing me to pursue the right balance of career and lifestyle.

Only time will tell whether this was the right decision, but I didn't want to look back later on in my life knowing I didn't take the chance and wonder what if.

Thank you very much for reading. You can expect future updates on how this decision is working out for me.
